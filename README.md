# Pathfinder DM Tools

## Setup

```
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```
.venv\Scripts\python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000. Use the "+ New" button to add a character by
Pathbuilder 2e link (e.g. `https://pathbuilder2e.com/json.php?id=123456`) or
just its numeric ID (e.g. `123456`). The character page shows the saved
Pathbuilder ID and has a Refresh button to re-fetch the latest build.
Saved characters appear in the foldable sidebar list, organized by group;
click one to view its data. If a new character's name matches one already
saved, you'll be asked whether to keep both (copy, the default) or override
the existing entry.

Use "+ New Group" to create a group, then use the group dropdown on a
character's page to assign it — a character can belong to at most one group.
Use the Delete button on a character's page to remove it (with confirmation).

The character sheet computes PF2e modifiers and DCs (DC = 10 + modifier) for
abilities, saves, perception, and skills, with Roll buttons (d20 + modifier).
Recent rolls appear in the sidebar's Roll History.

All data (characters, groups, roll history) is stored in the browser's
localStorage, so each user only sees their own characters. Character fetches
go directly to Pathbuilder from the browser (it allows CORS); when the app is
served by the local Flask server, that server also acts as a fetch fallback
and offers old server-side `data/` for a one-time import into the browser.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The app is fully static, so it deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): every push to `master`/`main` runs syntax
checks and publishes the `static/` folder.

One-time setup after pushing the repo to GitHub: in the repository settings,
under **Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
